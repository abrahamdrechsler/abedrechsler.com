                I'm a licensed architect and product manager who bridges the worlds of design, technology, and storytelling. Currently at Higharc, I lead product development focused on systematizing and automating residential design and documentation processes—bringing computational thinking to one of our most fundamental human needs: shelter. My architectural journey has taken me from intimate affordable housing projects to massive 1-million-square-foot hospital complexes during my time at renowned firms like KieranTimberlake and Ballinger, where I learned that great design scales from the deeply personal to the monumentally complex.<br><br>

                Beyond traditional practice, I'm drawn to understanding how people create spaces and communities in challenging circumstances. This curiosity led me to South America, where I directed and filmed a 45-minute documentary exploring informal settlements—a project that was screened internationally and deepened my appreciation for resourcefulness and human resilience. Originally from North Carolina, I bring together my technical expertise in digital design tools, hands-on project leadership experience, and a filmmaker's eye for narrative to help shape the future of how we design and build our built environment.<br><br>
