On wednesday 1/30

On Wednesday, January 28th, I am presenting a case study presentation. I have an interview with Bill and Asif and a product designer and two engineers. I am giving them 30 minutes of presentation and we'll have 30 minutes follow-up conversation. I plan to give them a presentation. The case study that I wanna give them is about townhomes.I think I'm going to give them the presentation based off of, I'll share my screen. It's a Zoom call, and I will probably, I'd like to build the presentation via Cursor and have it on my website. So it'll be an HTML page that's organized like a presentation.

Prompt from the company (Homebound):

Product Management Presentation Instructions:

There is no specific number of slides we’re looking for, but your presentation should address the following:

The problem/opportunity

What you were trying to achieve and why it was important to the business

How you measured success

The process you followed to get the product or feature built

Challenges you faced along the way and how you overcame them

How you drove and measured adoption

The final result

What went well and what you would do differently next time
