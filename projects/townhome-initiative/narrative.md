# Narrative: Townhome Initiative Web Presentation

This doc defines the **slide-by-slide narrative** and the **content you'll place on each slide**. It is intentionally optimized for a project that is **mid-delivery** (beta target April): the story makes clear what's **working now**, what's **in progress**, and what's **planned**—without diminishing the impact of the work.

**Default slide format:**
- Eyebrow (small): `Townhome Initiative Case Study`
- Title (big)
- Left: 2–4 bullets max
- Right: one dominant visual (or an intentional placeholder)

**Deep-dive slide pattern (repeatable):**
- *Problem* → *Before behavior* → *After design* → *Why it matters*

## Slide 3 — Introduction
**Title:** Introduction

**My Experience:**
- Product Leader working at intersection of AEC and technology
- Focused on reimagining how homes are designed, documented, and built
- Licensed Architect with 7+ years experience leading design teams and delivering complex projects
- Fun Fact: produced documentary on informal settlements in South America (withinformalcities.org)

**What Drives Me:**
- Excited about opportunities to improve the built environment—2% improvements at scale can be monumentally impactful
- Love envisioning things before they exist; enjoy working with multiple stakeholders to bring a singular vision to life

## Slide 4 — How Higharc Works Today
**Title:** How Higharc works today
- Platform for builders to design homes and produce: drawings, takeoffs, and visualizations
- Changes ripple across multiple products and downstream outputs

## Slide 5 — Why Townhomes?
**Title:** Why Townhomes?
- Multiple active customers pursuing townhomes in Higharc today—hitting significant limitations
- Unlocks ~$20M ARR in existing sales pipeline
- Opens the door to builders currently blocked without townhome support—massive TAM and gateway to larger builders
- Platform leverage: capabilities built for townhomes strengthen the foundation for all building types

## Slide 6 — Identifying the Most Critical Problems
**Title:** Identifying the most critical problems
- Interviewed current and prospective customers on townhome needs
- Conducted internal reviews with SMEs, Sales, and CSMs
- Stack ranked limitations strategically to build out functionality over time
- Aligned across org and leadership on the most severe problems to address first

**Visual:** Townhome limitations analysis

## Slide 7 — Team and Role
**Title:** Team and Role
- Decomposed the initiative into buildable platform capabilities
- Authored/owned core PRDs and aligned multiple teams on sequencing
- Managed dependencies, scope gates, and demo stability

**Visual:** Ownership map placeholder

---

## Slide 8 — Our Process
**Title:** Our Process
- Roadmap: POC → milestone demo → IBS validation → beta (April) → GA
- Sequenced platform primitives first, then UX polish
- Managed stability with demo files/branches and regression avoidance

**Visual:** Timeline strip placeholder

---

## Slide 9 — Defining Success
**Title:** Defining Success
- Defined success for standalone projects and broader townhome workflow
- Target incremental delivery and investment to ensure we're not over investing
- Specific targets to support Interest, Adoption, Production, Performance, and Revenue

**Visual:** Success Criteria panel (HTML/CSS) with milestone targets for IBS, Beta, GA, and Q2

## Slide 10 — The Product Solution (High Level)
**Title:** The product solution
- 1. Core Building Model Improvements: Datums + Levels, Walls, Foundations
- 2. Modeling Components / Units: Modeling Components, Reporting Units, Unit Options
- 3. Dedicated Builder and Sales Experience: Dedicated Townhome Workflow, Specialized Sales Views

**Visual:** Townhome workflow GIF

---

## Slide 11 — Deep Dive: Levels and Datums (Feature Deep Dive 1)
**Title:** Levels and Datums
- Problem: inconsistent references across systems; townhomes require split levels and mixed elevation conditions
- Before: each system had its own "truth"; single-stack level assumptions blocked overlapping contexts
- After: origin-relative datums align geometry; levels can overlap / split without breaking downstream systems

**Visual:** Split-level section diagram placeholder

---

## Slide 12 — Deep Dive: Modeling Components (Feature Deep Dive 2)
**Title:** Modeling Components, Reporting Units, and Options
- Problem: rooms aren't the right driver for slabs/walls; stepped conditions need explicit control
- Before: room-hosted foundations; no hierarchy for multi-unit; wall heights hard to represent
- After: user-authored boundaries; per-edge wall controls; building-level constraints with unit options

**Visual:** Townhome workflow GIF

---

## Slide 13 — Deep Dive: Showroom and Config (Feature Deep Dive 3)
**Title:** Showroom and Config for Townhomes
- Need to present one unit clearly while showing adjacency/shared walls
- Filtering modes: highlight current unit, dim others, isolate systems
- Critical for demo clarity and customer comprehension

**Visual:** Showroom screenshot placeholder

---

## Slide 14 — Next Steps for Initiative
**Title:** Next steps for initiative
- **Working now:** demo-proven capabilities and workflows
- **In progress:** beta hardening, edge cases, UX polish
- **Risks + mitigations:** migration, regressions, performance

**Visual:** 3-column status board (Working Now / In Progress / Risks)

---

## Slide 15 — Reflections
**Title:** Reflections
- **Keep:** decomposition, sequencing, cross-team alignment, risk burn-down via demos
- **Improve:** earlier migration strategy, shared visual language
- **Change:** earlier "demo-stable" definition, clearer sequencing docs

**Visual:** 3-column learnings layout (Keep / Improve / Change)

## Slide 16 — Q&A
**Title:** Q&A
- Prompt: "Happy to go deeper on tradeoffs, sequencing, or architecture choices."

**Visual:** Dark divider background

# Visual priorities (where real screenshots matter most)
- Why Townhomes (Slide 5)
- Identifying the most critical problems (Slide 6)
- The product solution (Slide 10)
- Deep dives (Slides 11–13)
- Our Process (Slide 9)

# Copy rules (keep it sharp)
- Titles should fit on one line when possible
- Bullets: 6–10 words each
- Avoid paragraphs except appendix
