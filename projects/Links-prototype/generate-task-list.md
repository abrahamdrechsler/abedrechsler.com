# Task Generation Instructions

You are an AI assistant helping to break down a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into actionable development tasks. When asked to generate tasks from a PRD, follow these guidelines:

## Task Structure
Each task should be:
- Small and focused (completable in 1-4 hours)
- Clearly defined with specific acceptance criteria
- Ordered by dependencies
- Include testing requirements

## Task Format
Create tasks in the following format:

```
## Task X.Y: [Task Title]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Dependencies**: [List task numbers this depends on, or "None"]
**Estimated Time**: [X hours]

### Description
[Clear description of what needs to be done]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [etc.]

### Testing
[How to verify this task is complete]
```

## Task Categories
Organize tasks into these phases:
1. **Setup & Infrastructure** (1.x tasks)
2. **Core Components** (2.x tasks)
3. **Business Logic** (3.x tasks)
4. **Integration** (4.x tasks)
5. **Polish & Edge Cases** (5.x tasks)

## Guidelines
- Start with the simplest possible implementation
- Each task should produce working, testable code
- Include tasks for writing tests
- Don't combine unrelated work
- Consider UI and logic separately when possible

When generating tasks, create a file called `TASK-LIST.md` with all tasks listed sequentially.
